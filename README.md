# Overview

Providing updates on stocks through Yahoo Finance API. 

The app displays the stock price, percent change of the company for the day and the PE ratio for a given comapny. This is display when the backend server calls the Yahoo Finace API and displays any given parameters. In order to have the app update it is connected to Firebase FCM which is connected to Pusher which then sends updates about a given stock.

I created this app to get stock updates about the market. There are different aspects of a company that can be looked up and right now I have the stock price, the percent change, and PE ratio of the company.
